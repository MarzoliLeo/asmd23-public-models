# Task 1: VERIFIER
Code and do some analysis on the Readers & Writers Petri Net. Add a test to check that in no path long at most 100 states mutual
exclusion fails (no more than 1 writer, and no readers and writers together). Can you extract a small API for representing safety properties?
What other properties can be extracted? How the boundness assumption can help?
